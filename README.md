# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for ER Wait Time App

---

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements, features, and roadmap for the development of an ER wait time application. This app will provide real-time emergency room wait times for hospitals, using data extracted programmatically from known URLs. The application aims to help patients make informed decisions by providing the most up-to-date wait times and suggesting the optimal hospital based on their location and current wait times.

#### 1.2. Scope
The scope of this document includes the core functionalities of the ER wait time app, including data extraction, user interface, API integrations, and future enhancements. It will serve as a roadmap for the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project requirements and milestones.

### 2. Project Overview
#### 2.1. Objectives
- Provide real-time ER wait times for hospitals.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for accessing wait time data.
- Integrate with Google Maps API to provide estimated travel times.
- Suggest hospitals with the shortest wait times and optimal travel routes.
- Schedule regular updates to ensure data accuracy.

#### 2.2. Key Features
- Real-time wait time extraction from hospital websites.
- Map view displaying nearby hospitals with wait times.
- Estimated travel times and directions.
- Suggested hospitals based on location and wait times.
- Regular data updates via cron jobs.
- Additional hospital information and services.

### 3. Functional Requirements
#### 3.1. Data Extraction
- **Manual URL List**: Initially, the app will use manually collected URLs where hospitals post ER wait times.
- **Programmatic Data Extraction**: Develop a method to programmatically extract wait times from these URLs.
- **Data Parsing**: Parse the extracted data to identify and store wait times.

#### 3.2. User Interface (UI)
- **Home Screen**: Map view with current location and nearby hospitals.
- **Hospital Information**: List of hospitals with wait times and services offered.
- **Wait Time Display**: Real-time wait times for each hospital.
- **Suggested Hospitals**: Recommendations based on shortest wait times and estimated travel times.

#### 3.3. API Integrations
- **Google Maps API**: Integrate to provide map functionality, estimated travel times, and directions.
- **Traffic Data API**: Use traffic data to improve travel time estimates.

#### 3.4. Data Update Mechanism
- **Cron Jobs**: Schedule data extraction and updates every 15 minutes to ensure accuracy.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for failed data extraction attempts.

#### 3.5. Additional Features
- **Urgent Care Integration**: Expand to include urgent care centers.
- **Insurance Integration**: Allow users to filter hospitals based on in-network providers.
- **Hospital Services**: Display additional services provided by each hospital.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
#### 4.1. Performance
- The app should load wait time data within 3 seconds.
- Updates should run efficiently in the background without impacting user experience.

#### 4.2. Scalability
- The system should be designed to handle an increasing number of hospitals and users.
- Future integrations (e.g., urgent care, insurance) should be easily incorporable.

#### 4.3. Security
- Ensure data privacy and secure handling of user information.
- Protect against potential scraping blocks and CAPTCHAs.

#### 4.4. Usability
- The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Provide clear instructions and feedback to users.

### 5. Technical Requirements
#### 5.1. Platform
- Web application, initially with a potential mobile app in the future.

#### 5.2. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js for the user interface.
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django) for data extraction and API handling.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing hospital data and wait times.
- **APIs**: Google Maps API, Traffic Data API.

### 6. Milestones and Roadmap
#### 6.1. Phase 1: Proof of Concept
- Collect URLs and manually extract wait times.
- Basic web app with map view and wait time display.
- Programmatic data extraction and parsing.

#### 6.2. Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Integrate Google Maps API.
- Develop recommendation algorithm.
- Implement cron jobs for regular updates.

#### 6.3. Phase 3: Enhancements
- Add urgent care centers.
- Integrate insurance provider filters.
- Display additional hospital services.

#### 6.4. Phase 4: Future Expansions
- Mobile app development.
- Additional features based on user feedback and market needs.

### 7. Assumptions and Dependencies
- Hospital websites consistently update their wait times.
- APIs (Google Maps, Traffic Data) remain accessible and reliable.
- Adequate resources and expertise available for development.

### 8. Risks and Mitigations
- **Data Inconsistency**: Implement regular checks and error handling.
- **API Limitations**: Monitor usage and optimize API calls.
- **Scalability Issues**: Plan for cloud infrastructure to handle growth.
